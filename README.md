**Titanic Analysis and Prediction**
This Jupyter Notebook provides an analysis of the Titanic dataset, exploring survival patterns and developing predictive models to estimate passenger survival probabilities based on various features.

**Features**
**Data Preprocessing:**
1.Handling missing values
2.Encoding categorical variables
3.Feature engineering

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
1.Visualizations to understand survival distributions
2.Analysis of passenger demographics (e.g., age, gender, class)

**Model Development:**
1.Training machine learning models to predict survival
2.Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy and precision

**Insights and Interpretations:**
1.Discussing factors that influence survival probabilities
2.Presenting results with visual aids

**Requirements**
The notebook uses Python and the following libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Ensure you have these installed in your environment.

**Outcomes**
The analysis provides insights into the factors affecting survival and offers a functional predictive model for the Titanic dataset.
